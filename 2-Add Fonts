// there is two ways one is old and a new way .
//the old way sends request to google every time a user opens your site , its by adding Link inside the Head of _document.js.
//the second way is by npm i @next/font when you use whis way when you deploy your project it sends a requset to the font resource , take it then
put it on your server , and in this way you dont need to send a reauest to the resource of the font every time.
//in second way we put the font requset in _app.js.
