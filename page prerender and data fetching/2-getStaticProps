//we have to call it in a Page , not in normalk component .
// SSR server static generation  ,   next works with SSR and ISR with revalidate . (we will explain later)
//just be aware that http requests are sended in client side after the page is loaded .
//this is why we neØ«d getStaticProps () to send http request and fetch data before rendering the Page on the screen .
//so now we know that nextjs , make any static html code  , and store prernder it on server automatically , when we have http requsts we use getStaticProps 
 instead of useEffesct to fetch data and implemented it to the Page before rendreing it on client side .
//so nextjs  , executes getStaticProps then send the page to the client .
// notice that the code in getStaticProps will never be visible on client side .
// we have to return object  contains object its name "props" that contains what we want to return .
// in getStaticProps you can write serverside code becaues the client cant see that like creditnilas  , 
or like node fileSystem wich cant work in client side .
//when you do some thing like import fs from 'fs '  nextjs knows that this server code you want to use in getStaticProps () so it wont execute on client Side .
//notice that you can work with nodejs fileSystem in getStaticProps () wich is some thing we cant do on clientside .
// notice that getStaticProps() runs just once when you RUN BUILD command  , so what we  do if the data we fetch changed .
//solution 1 : fetch data with use Effect ().
//solution 2 :  RUN BUILD command again .
//solution 3 : ISR incremental static generation , it means that server will rerun getStaticProps() automatically again if X Time passed from the 
last request for the page .
