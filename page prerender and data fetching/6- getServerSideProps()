// nextjs have two type of  prerendering  , Staic , and Server Side Rendering .
//Static contains SSR and ISR .
// in getStaticProps() we dont have access to the requset the user sends .
//so we  need server  rendering , like when want to see the users jwt , or query  .... .
//so we have getServerSideProps() wich is a function will be executed  on the server  not on the client side , it will be executed with every request the users 
hit .
//the return object is exactly like getStaticProps() just revalidate is not exccest .
// in contex parameter in getServersideProps () we have .
// with getServerSidePorps ()  the pages wont be prerendered  because it need data from server with every request .
const {params,req,res} = context ,  so we can manipulate  the req and res values and headers .
// Λ λ this sembol in means that the page doesnt prernder  (this case happens when you use getServerSideProps ()) .
// white circle means the page is prernderd with content , empty circle means that the page was prerndered without content .
