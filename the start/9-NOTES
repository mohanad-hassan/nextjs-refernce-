//<Head></Head> any where inside jsx .
//appjs is the root file , Component inside indexs to the current page so if you layout something in it it willshows in all pages .
//so if you use Head in appjs it will shows to all pages of the project .
//nextjs merges the content of Head in appjs and page compnent , if their is reflex it uses the last value , you can use more than one Head in same page 
and nextjs will merge all of them together .
// _appjs represents the main compnent in html page .
//_document.js represents the document.
//in document js there is Html Head Main wich presents main next compnent and there you can add html content out side of next js , and you can use them 
with react  portals .
