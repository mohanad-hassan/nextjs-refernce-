// to add images from api you to define that api in config.js before using it .
//ssg isr ssr three ways to render the content .
//with ssg if you dont have external data you dont have to any thing,if it have external data you have to apply function.
//the function is get static props , you can exported only from pages  , meant for all routes.
//you will use it in the page , and then use it as props in the compnent of that page.
//get static props function  works on server side , only runs at build time , wont be incleded in client bundle , 
on dev mode runs on server and client bundle.
//https://next-code-elimination.vercel.app/   this web site you wrote a code and it will show the client bundle code .
//what is not showed on client side , is called on server side .
//<></>  fragment.
// get static paths function is for prerender content for dynamic routes , must export from a page , that page also must implement get static props , 
only runs at build time ,only runs on server side , wont be included in client bundle , on dev mode runs on client and sever side .
//running function in build time it means that  it runs just one time when calling the website.
//get static props is like use effect but faster .
//react without nextjs is so bad for SEO because it sends empty html to client then javascript renders the contetnt  tHAT GOOGLE WONT see any content .
//nextjs has two forms of prerendering , static generation and server side rendering .
//the first one static generation gets data from the server just on build time .
//you use for it  a function called export  async getStaticProps() { return {props: { ...} }}.
//when you Rclick in brouser and view source code with react app you will see nothing .
//if you hardcode html code  it will prerender html code and show it in view source code and it will show for search engines.
//the getstaticprops is loaded then the copmonent .
//when you use the getstaticprops the data fetch occurs on the server and send it to the client , if you dont use it fetch will occurs in clientbundle 
wich means data wont be showed to the  search engine and its bad seo.
//differnce between  useEffect and getstatic props that is get static props runs on servers side wich means the data you fetched will shows in the html file 
you send to the client and  if you use use Effect it will fetch data on clientbundle wich means it wont show in html you send to the client and this is so 
bad for seo .
