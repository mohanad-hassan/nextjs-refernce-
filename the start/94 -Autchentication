//there is two kind of authentication , implemnted with next js  called server side sessions , type2 is node tokens.
//SPA works with tokens inasted of sessions  , JWT : json web tokens.
//we use next auth package and install it to use it , ith some thing like 0Auth .

//its not best practice to store passwords in data base its better to encrypt them and then you can decrypt them when ever you want .
//to do that we use a package called bcrypt.
//create a auth folder in api folder , create [...nextauth].js .
//credintials provider means our database .
//bcrypt has a compare function to compare password with a hashed password wich returns a boolean value.
//there is seesion cokie wich you see it when you log in and gives a control.
//wich be deleted if you log out .
//and theses useSession hoo kis what we use to protect Routes.
//there is useSession wich have some bugs with loading proerty wich dont load it always , inasted of the there is getSession .
//getSession is async function that returns a promise , we use with it useState and useEffect.
//what we did pervious is client side ProtectRoute.
//ServerSIde protect:in getServerside function   , we use getSessions function to check if we log on or not 
const session  = getSession({req:context.req})
if(!session) {return redirect or what ever you want }.
//window.location.href to navigate to some where ofcourse it refresh the project .
