//any code in get static props is implemented in servers side .
//import fs from 'fs' includes file system from node js , and you cant do it in client side , because client cant acces to node js . 
//fs.readfile or fs.readfileasync to bring data and use it .
//npm run start to open your project in client mode and not development mode .
//so when your project is static  , if you dont have exrenal data you dont have to do any thing and if you have external data you need to use a function 
called getstaticprops .
//ISR incremental static generation its like static just you add a automatic refresh to the page , in getstatic props you add to return  a key called 
revalidate:10 or any seconds you want inasted on 10 .
//notfound:true   if you use this key in getstaticprops it returns error 404.
//their redirect key to redirect to another page , as example if you failed to fetch data .
