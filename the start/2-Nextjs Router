//there is 3 ways to create Route in nextjs   index Routes Nested Routes (normal) and dynamic Routes(like products pages) .
//any file you called index.js is the default Router .
// next uses file based routing , not code based routing .
//creatin a js file in pages folder makes it a Router .
//rules of Routing : the js file must be a react component , the component must be exported by default.
//if ypu try to open un excest page it will return 404 Error.
// how to make nsested Routes ? create a folder inside a page and give it a name  now set index.js to be the deault Route and set normal Routes inside it .
//to make a dynamic Route its just like the pervious one what changes is just right the name will changes inside [name].js .
//you can read the dynamic path that showed in the browser up , by hook useRouter 
//useROuter returns object , and the path in query key .
//linking to pages : there is two type of pages dynamic and undynamic .
//there is Link hook from to next to navigate between pages .
//if you use ANCHOR tag inasted of link it will reload the whole page and it will not be SPA.
//the syntax is exactly like ANCHOR just wite Link.
//syntax :<Link href='/'> back to home </Link>.
//there is a lot of props for Link hook like href   scroll its boolean responsed of take the page scrool to the top after navigating from it default is true.
//to link to nondsynamic pages just write its name .
//for nested Routing we have to set folders in Pages Folder .
