// its like getstaticprops but we use it for dynamic routes .
//there is a context parameter in getsstaticprops give a informations , example const {params} = context ,  params.routername you put inside [] to get the 
params , 
//the pervious code is semantically right but it will not work , it will give error that you need get static paths function.
//get static props doesnt work with dynamic route because nextjs dont know any page to prerender and ofcourse it wont prerender all the dynamic routes 
this is why wee need get static paths .
//get static paths works just on pages and doesnt work on compnents.
//we use get static props and get static paths together .
//getsrtaticpaths() { return {params:{id1:id2}}}.   id 1 is what you wrote in [] and 2 is the dynamic value and you have to write all the dynamic values 
and also write fallback:false or it will not work .
//explain the fallback key , it help if you have a lot of dynamic pages that you have ,  what you but in paths will prerender and ready to use , but if you 
have a lot of products if you do that your application will be to slow , inasted of that you can load just the most visited pages or products , and what 
is raredly visited will prerender when the user clikc on it , set this fallbacak:true .
//when you use get static props the page will prerender , and this is why wee nedd getstatic paths.
//when you set fallback true   if you get to the pdoduct route manually you will have error because it fetch data late in melli seconds ,
the solution is with set loading spinner until fetch data or fallback:'blocking'.
