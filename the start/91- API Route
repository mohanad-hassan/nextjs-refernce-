//REst Api is normal api where you send request with data and have a respnse with data .
//Api route we use it like in sign up pages to store data in database and not to have html return .
// you can store data in database with Post and read it with Get methods .
//you find it inside pages   its folder called api .
//there you can add pages  with .js in the end .
//any code you write in api will never run on client bundle it will run on server side .
// you shouldnt use fetch function inside getStaticProps or getServerSideProps to talk to your own api insated of that you can export function from api , 
and run it directly in getStaticProps , because they are on the same server you dont have to send a http request.
//we use that when we need to use data from database to prerender a page on our project .
//prerener dynamic pages with apiRoute :
