//  there is a lot of big size images  with mp .
//we have to optimize them with nextjs .
//when we use Image component  will preprare a lot of versions of that image , and send them due to  client devices like phone tablet labtop pc .
//you have to set width and height  for Image component .
//for chrome it changes jpeg format to webp .
//it reduces size from arround 36 mp to 20 kb with the same resulution .
//Image makse pictures lazy loaded , wich mean they wont be loaded untill user scroll . so IMPORTANT .
the images you put in Image will be in .next /cached  when npm run build .
EXAMPLE :
// import Image from 'next/image'
< Image src = {'/'} width ={} height = {}  /> this width and height detrminas the width and height will be fetched , the final result will be with css styles .
//also their is a lot of more  attributes , .
